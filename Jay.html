Hello! It is currently <strong>9:42 PM</strong> We are back from Colorado. I forgot to update this website, but I have learned a lot. Such as tables...<br>
<br>
Here is are some examples:
<br>
<br>
<table height="100" width="400" border="1" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<th rowspan="4" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="4" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th colspan="3">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="2">&nbsp;</th>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th colspan="5">Design 1</th>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<table height="100" width="400" border="1" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="4" width=85>Design 2</th>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="2" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th colspan="2">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<table height="100" width="400" border="1" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<th rowspan="5" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
		<td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="5" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="3">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th colspan="3">Design 3</th>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<table height="100" width="400" border="1" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2" colspan="2" width="55">&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="5" width="85">&nbsp;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th rowspan="2" colspan="2">Design 4</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
</table>
